  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>
    I was born July 30th, 1985 in Philadelphia Pennsylvania. I still currently live in the city and it is where I've been my entire life. As a child I grew up in the Mount Airy section of Philly and attended grade school around that neighborhood as well. I have three siblings and a very large family. The love my family shares for one another is what perpetuated my desire to help others. As I ventured into adulthood, became a wife and mother my purpose became clear. My desire is to help people that lack the resources to properly support themselves. It is this vision that led me to enroll into Delaware County Community College as a social work major. My area of focus is the study of human behavior because it better equips me to assist and meet the needs of the individuals I want to serve. More recently, I resigned from a non-profit company I had been working for since the age of 18 to go into business with my spouse. We are now the proud owners of two of Philadelphia's best auto tag agencies. Business ownership has assisted me with developing great customer service skills and allowed me to persue my dreams.
  
  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
  <p>
    My hobbies include reading books; more specifically biographies. I love to travel the world and I try my best to expose my children to many cultures and societies. I truly believe exposure plays a significant role in the development of a well rounded individual. I also enjoy fine dining at restaurants. My favorite restaurant by far is the Brazilian Steakhouse known as Fugo de Chao.

  <h3>5 Year Goals</h3>
  <p>
    In five years I envision myself as a graduate from not only Delaware County Community College, but also Temple University. Temple has an admirable social work program and curriculum. I hope to be actively working on the blueprint for the recovery home I aspire to open for families that suffer from drug addiction and mental illness. So many of these individuals need help, but get turned away because they have children they don't want to leave behind. That's one amongst many other disturbing reasons that people get turned away. I want to be the door opener for the people who have struggled behind every door closed in their face. I want to show compassion and support to those who just need a little love and guidance. No matter where I am in five years I know I will be somewhere helping someone in need. If I can make a difference in the life of just one person that would be all the affirmation I need.
